# JSONFiles
The aim of this project is to provide the valuable JSON raw data for QA. 
When I first started in this industry, the major concern was about filling data for performing QA. In my journey of 9+ years in the field of IT, what I have found is that most of the times, QA is performed on data which can easily be considered as garbage.
Hence I am planning to start this project which can contain only json data for filling up the files with some valid data. 
I am planning to add some data in atleast 1 file atleast once a week. So that over a period of time, the data starts growing in a right direction. The biggest pain while working on the project is data. And as JSON is a universally accepted format, I am planning to create JSON files.
